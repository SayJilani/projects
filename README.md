The following repo contains jupyter notebooks tackling the following projects:

breast_cancer_model : Utilzed logistic regression to identify breast cancer from quantitative data
brain_tumor_classification : Using Feedforward Neural Networks on Image classificcation tasks to identify different brain Tumors. A second model utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks was utilized to compare the two model accuracies. (CNN model added on 07/05/23)
titanic_model : Predicting survival based on socieconomic factors (ongoing)
